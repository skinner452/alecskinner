            My name is Alec Skinner. Originally from Nebraska, I now live in
            Bloomfield, New Jersey. My journey into coding began at 12 when I
            first discovered how to tweak files for my PC games. I was
            fascinated by how even the smallest changes in code could alter the
            gameplay, and that sparked my obsession with programming. I started
            taking coding classes during my junior year of high school, and my
            passion for learning and building has only grown since. Today, I
            specialize in creating user-centric applications, with expertise
            across both front-end and back-end technologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my next career move, I&apos;m looking for a role that allows me
            to combine my expertise in frameworks like React, React Native, Go,
            and SQL with opportunities to learn and explore new technologies.
            I&apos;m seeking a remote or hybrid position in the New Jersey or
            New York City area where I can collaborate with talented and driven
            professionals. My goal is to contribute to building impactful,
            innovative products while continuing to grow my skills and advance
            my career.

            <p>
              During my studies at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, I
              focused on building a strong foundation in computer science,
              particularly algorithms and data structures. I worked with a team
              on my senior project, where we developed a system to monitor pig
              behavior using Kinect cameras. We gathered data from the cameras
              and used the D3 library for data visualization, while MongoDB was
              used for storing and processing the data. This project was a
              collaboration that combined my interests in data visualization,
              NoSQL databases, and .NET development. It also reinforced my
              understanding of algorithms and systems design, and gave me
              hands-on experience in both team dynamics and problem-solving.

              During my time at AMPT, I worked with a small team to develop and
              iterate on the company&apos;s web and mobile applications. I
              utilized technologies including React, React Native, Django,
              Laravel, AWS, and SQL to build scalable and user-centric
              platforms. I integrated services such as Slack, Gmail, and Outlook
              to enhance the functionality of the AMPT platform. In addition, I
              created one-off applications, including integrations with
              Amazon&apos;s Fire Stick and customer-facing tablets. My role also
              involved using customer feedback to drive product iterations,
              ensuring continuous improvement of the user experience.
